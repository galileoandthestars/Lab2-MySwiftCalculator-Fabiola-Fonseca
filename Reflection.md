When creating the first calculator console app, the process of setting up the project was pretty straightforward and easy in XCode. Once started, using swift was a bit challenging since I'm more accustomed to using Java, therefore, my problem-solving is catered to the Java language. It was interesting to construct the solution in swift thanks to the type inference, and conciseness. One thing that proved to be confusing at first, is the difference between var and let and when to use it inside different structure's scope. For example, when asking for the user inputs, inside the menu while loop, it is more intuitive to me to use a var instead of a let. However, the compiler detected that, once the while loop was over, the var was not changed. I then realised that using let was necessary to maintain data consistency. As for input validations, every input that was not a number (aka. letters, words, nil, ...) would be defaulted to a value 0.  In conclusi√≥n, having the experience of a practical application of Swift helped me understand it more deeply.
